# GraphQLBuilder 

GraphQLBuilder is a package that can support the creation of GraphQL queries. It provides various methods for translating dicts or lists into mutation objects, which can then be used in a gql query. 

Attention! This package is optimized for using a hasura.io endpoint - not all GraphQL functions are supported.
